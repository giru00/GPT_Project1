      "1. Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Drain the rice and let it sit for 30 minutes.\n",
      "2. In a large pot, bring the water to a boil. Add the rice and cook for about 20 minutes, or until the rice is soft.\n",
      "3. Drain the rice and let it cool to room temperature.\n",
      "4. In a large bowl, mix the nuruk and yeast with the cooked rice. Cover the bowl with a clean cloth and let it sit at room temperature for 3-4 days, stirring occasionally.\n",
      "5. After 3-4 days, strain the mixture through a cheesecloth to remove any solids. Transfer the liquid to a clean container and let it sit for another 2-3 days to ferment further.\n",
      "6. Once the soju has fermented to your desired taste, strain it again through a cheesecloth to remove any remaining solids. Transfer the liquid to a bottle and store it in the refrigerator until ready to serve.\n",
